This first challenge requires little actual coding. The main goal of it is to get you familiar with the CMS and seeing how editing information will impact the live site.

If you're getting stuck on this first challenge, make sure that you have the design system, CMS and frontend all running locally and that you're not getting any errors. 

If you can't access the Sanity Studio, you may need to be added to the account. Please reach out for access.

The page to edit can be found by selecting Pages -> Challenges -> One within the running studio in your browser. For the first part of the challenge, you need to select the existing Media Module that has been added to the page and simply change the image inside of it. Don't forget to publish after you make the changes!

For the second part of this challenge, you need to add the existing Quote component to this page. When you click 'Add Item' within Sanity you may notice that you only have the option to add another media module - check out home-page.js and see if you can find out how to add the quote data model to challenge-page.js
